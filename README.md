Good evening Boxer Families,

Next week is the Week of Respect, and Escobedo Middle School has planned some fun activities for each day.  We hope all of our students will join us in celebrating the Week of Respect through their participation in the events.

Monday Respect Yourself Day - Dress for Success!
Students and staff members are encouraged to show respect for themselves by dressing for success. Each lunch, 20 students will be selected by a staff member in the cafeteria who exemplifies self-respect. These students will receive a special prize.
